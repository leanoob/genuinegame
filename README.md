# genuinegame

we will make a game

## Build
The build depends on:

- [rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo)
- [lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune)

```bash
./localbuild
```

# General Guideline
- Will merge almost any PR, merges are automatically published to the game
- PRs should not be for the purpose of destroying things added by other people 
- Try to keep your code isolated (server/yourname, client/yourname)
- Won't accept anything that breaks roblox tos
- Do not modify assets.rbxl
