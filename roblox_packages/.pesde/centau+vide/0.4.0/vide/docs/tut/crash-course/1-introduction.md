# Introduction

This is a tutorial that introduces the concepts and usage of Vide.

Vide is heavily inspired by [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/).

## Why Vide?

Vide's reactive and declarative API aims to let you program UI as simply as
possible, with a strong focus on how data flows through your application.

Some of Vide's main design choices:

- Syntax minimal.
- Data oriented.
- Typechecking compatible.
- Instance independent.

Vide's reactivity operates with the concept
of scopes which carries a learning curve, though is what makes Vide's minimal
syntax possible. The crash course will introduce these concepts gradually.
